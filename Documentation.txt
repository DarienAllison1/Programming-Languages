void findMostCommonCharacter(const string &input)
What it does: This function takes the string entered by the user and finds which character appears the most. It then prints that character and how many times it shows up.

Input:
input: The string the user provides. It is passed by reference, meaning the program uses the original string without making a copy.

Variables:
vector<int> indexes: A list of 128 elements (one for each possible character in ASCII), all starting at 0. It keeps track of how often each character appears.
maxCount: A number that stores the highest count of any character.
mostCommonChar: A variable that holds the character that appears the most.

How it works:
Counting characters: It goes through each character in the string, converting each to uppercase. The program looks up the ASCII value of the character and increases its count in the indexes list.
Finding the most common character: The program checks which character in the indexes list has the highest count.
Print the result: It prints the character that occurs the most and how many times it appears.
Returns: The function doesn't return anything. Instead, it prints the result directly.

int main()
What it does: This is the main part of the program. It asks the user for a string, calls the function findMostCommonCharacter to process it, and shows the result.

Variables:
string input: A variable to store the string entered by the user.

How it works:
Getting input: The user is asked to enter a string. getline(cin, input) is used to allow for multi-word input.
Calling the function: The function findMostCommonCharacter(input) is called, which processes the input string and prints the result.
Returns: The main function returns 0 to show the program ran successfully.
